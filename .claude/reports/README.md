## How Reports are Generated

When you run `/tokens-audit`, the agent:

1. Scans codebase for violations
2. Generates detailed report
3. Saves to `.claude/reports/token-audit-{date}.md`
4. Presents summary in chat
5. Offers to fix issues

## Report Retention

- **Keep**: Last 5 audits for history tracking
- **Archive**: Older reports can be moved to `docs/audits/archive/`
- **Git**: Reports are tracked in git to see improvement over time
